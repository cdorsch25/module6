<h1>My Dreams</h1>

<p>
I have many dreams I want to reach or accomplish in my lifetime:<br>
</p>

<p>
I want to eventually teach at a university something I am passionate about.<br>
I want to return to Ball State and revive the Book Arts Collaborative program.<br>
I want to own my own home.<br>
I want to record a collection of my favorite poems to leave behind when I am gone,<br>
like the one below.<br>
</p>

<p>
These are just some of the things I dream about, and aspire to achieve.
